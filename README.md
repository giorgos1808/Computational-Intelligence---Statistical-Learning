# Computational Intelligence - Statistical Learning Projects

Welcome to the repository featuring implementations of a Support Vector Machine (SVM), Kernel Principal Component Analysis plus Linear Discriminant Analysis (KPCA+LDA), and data dimension reduction techniques based on spectral graph analysis. These techniques are applied to solve class separation problems in MNIST or Cifar-10 datasets.

## Project Overview
This repository contains three main programs:

<ol>
  <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
  This program implements a Support Vector Machine for class separation in MNIST or Cifar-10 datasets. The SVM is trained, tested, and its performance is compared with other classifiers.
  <li>Kernel Principal Component Analysis + Linear Discriminant Analysis (KPCA+LDA)</li>
  This program implements the KPCA+LDA method for multi-class separation in MNIST or Cifar-10 datasets. The feature extraction involves using PCA to reduce the data dimension, keeping more than 90% of the information.
  <li>Data Dimension Reduction and Spectral Clustering</li>
  This program implements data dimension reduction techniques based on spectral graph analysis or sample similarities (t-SNE). The resulting data in 2 dimensions are subsequently clustered by spectral clustering, and the groups are visualized with different colors.

Feel free to explore, run the programs, and analyze the performance of SVM, KPCA+LDA, and dimension reduction techniques with spectral clustering.
